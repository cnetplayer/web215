<ul>
		<li>At what moment in class this week did you feel most engaged with what was happening?<br>
		<strong>When researching the tools in the JS Stack assignment. This helped me to understand so many new tools and how they can work together in a real-world environment.</strong>		</li>
		<li>At what moment in class this week were you most distanced from what was happening?<br>
		<strong>When doing 5 chapters of reading. Although I see how helpful the text is, it's not very engaging of a read and I was &quot;checking out&quot; a lot while trying to struggle my way through it.</strong></li>
		<li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took this weekend did you find most affirming or helpful?<br>
		<strong>When Kevin Anderson actually complemented my JS Stack assignment. Coming from someone who obviously has a stronger grasp on most of that stuff definitely helps me to know I'm starting to get it.</strong>		</li>
		<li>What action that anyone took this weekend did you find most puzzling or confusing?<br>
		<strong>None.</strong>		</li>
		<li>What about the class this weekend surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).<br>
		<strong>How steeply the number of assignment submissions have already dropped three weeks in to class. We started with nearly full class participation, and now only about 6-8 members of the class are actually submitting work. Wondering if we can help anyone?</strong>		</li>
