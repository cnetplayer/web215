<p>I'm much more a front-end &quot;designer&quot;, so much of what I'm learning is still a little new to me. I can't speak to specific quality of some of these, but these are some of the best resources I have found to learn more about these technologies.</p>
<ol>
		<li>Front-End Development - I can pretty comfortably talk about or learn more about these.
				<ol>
						<li>CSS Sprites - I have used sprites several times in the past few years. I have found these two articles to be the best in explaining how to use them.
								<ul>
										<li><a href="http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/" target="_blank">CSS Tricks</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/27/the-mystery-of-css-sprites-techniques-tools-and-tutorials/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a></li>
								</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Scripted CSS - I know 'about' this concept, but have never put it to use. I'm interested to learn more about it though.
								<ul>
										<li><a href="http://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/" target="_blank">Sass vs. LESS from CSS Tricks</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://www.lesscss.org/" target="_blank">CSS LESS Website</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) Website</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-LESS-SASS/107921-2.html" target="_blank">A Lynda.com Tutorial comparing these two Scripted CSS Tools</a></li>
								</ul>
						</li>
						<li>JavaScript &amp; jQuery - I still have much to learn about using these languages. But, when I get stuck, I can usually find an answer here.
								<ul>
										<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript Page</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery.com Website</a></li>
								</ul>
						</li>
				</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Back-End Development - These, I'm still very undereducated about, but very anxious to learn more. I can't really provide great learning resources yet, since I can make a determination if the material is helpful.
				<ul>
						<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> - I'm lost here. I've read and watched several tutorials, but I'm still unsure I completely understand it.</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> - A non-relational database that can be a repository when using Node. Still trying to work out my understanding here.</li>
						<li>This is a the <a href="http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Nodejs-Essential-Training/141132-2.html" target="_blank">Lynda.com Tutorial</a> I've been watching in some spare time to try to wrap my head around these two tools.</li>
				</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Frameworks - Again, I haven't spent much time working with different frameworks, but I have done some reading. Here's some of the better articles I've read.
				<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/top-10-front-end-development-frameworks/" target="_blank">Top 10 Front-End Development Frameworks</a>	from	Sitepoint				</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.webdirections.org/the-state-of-the-web-2008/back-end-development-languages-and-systems/" target="_blank">Back end development languages and systems</a> from Web Directions</li>
						<li><a href="http://memeburn.com/2011/06/32-web-frameworks-to-choose-from-for-your-next-project/" target="_blank">32 web frameworks to choose from for your next project		</a>from Memeburn</li>
						<li><a href="http://designinstruct.com/roundups/html5-frameworks/" target="_blank">10 Best Responsive HTML5 Frameworks and Tools</a> from Design Instruct</li>
