<ul>
		<li><strong>Ember.js</strong> - A client-side JavaScript web application framework based on an model-view-controller architecture. The focus seems to be on making the code more scalable and also to incorporate best practices. It also is designed to work with Handlebars.js, a web template system.</li>
		<li><strong>SASS (SCSS)</strong> - A pre-processor that allows you to write CSS with so much more control. The use of variables alone makes this tool very exciting to learn. But JavaScript pros will really like the ability to write CSS in a way more familiar to them with nesting, inheritance and even operators that allow you to do math right in the CSS.</li>
		<li><strong>Rake for build (includes imgoptim)</strong> - A software task management tool. Built on Ruby and using Ruby syntax, this tool allows tasks to run to compress and compile files for the fastest transmission to the client-side.</li>
		<li><strong>Guard for automatic rebuild</strong> - A file maintenance tool built on Ruby. Allows the developer to simply update pre-processed files (like SASS, for example) and see the changes in an instant.</li>
		<li><strong>JSHint for linting</strong> - An open-source tool for checking and ensuring accuracy in JavaScript. A very helpful tool when working in a team or keeping larger files in check.</li>
		<li><strong>JSCover for test coverage</strong> - A tool for measuring code coverage for JavaScript. Useful for building testing suits to run on JavaScript and can run on the browser.</li>
		<li><strong>Jasmine and The Intern for testing</strong> - Measures to make sure that the code has met specific unit criteria and helps to discover any potential for failures in the code.</li>
		<li><strong>Selenium for more testing</strong> - A browser automation tool. Designed to help test the limits of code from a client perspective, but without having to manually run each and every test.</li>
		<li><strong>Cucumber for business rules</strong> - A tool used to help test the code, but approached from a way that non-software developers can contribute. The business rules are written in a more readable way, and then translated to testable code. Helping to bridge the divide between the 'business' folks and the 'tech' folks.</li>
