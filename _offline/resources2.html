<p>I have used multiple resources to accomplish the Node.js and MongoDB assignment. Some of these are from the Node for Beginners list and some I have found myself.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3>Resources from Node for Beginners</h3>
<ul>
  <li>cwbuecheler.com tutorials - These are great because the writer addresses me like I have common sense, but need a little break down on what exactly all the technical stuff means and does. Couldn't have figured most of this out without these tutorials.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/" target="_blank">THE DEAD-SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR FRONT-END DEVELOPERS TO GETTING UP AND RUNNING WITH NODE.JS, EXPRESS, JADE, AND MONGODB</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/" target="_blank">CREATING A SIMPLE RESTFUL WEB APP WITH NODE.JS, EXPRESS, AND MONGODB</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TutorialIndustry.com - Short and sweet resources to extend your learning.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.tutorialindustry.com/node-js-mongodb-tutorial-for-beginners" target="_blank">Node.js Mongodb: Express, Mongoose Installation, Examples</a></li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>flippinawesome.org - Really great information to understand the workings of Express.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://flippinawesome.org/2013/05/28/intro-to-express-js-parameters-error-handling-and-other-middleware/" target="_blank">Intro to Express.js Parameters, Error Handling and Other Middleware</a></li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Resources I have used</h3>
			  <ul>
			    <li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-monk.html" target="_blank">Marcus Node Bits: monk is an easy way to access MongoDb</a> - In researching various ways of connecting MongoDB and Node, I found I just liked the way Monk worked better. I'm certainly still experimenting with Mongoose, but what I could make work with Monk would not when I rewrote it using Mongoose. I like the idea of the schema design of Mongoose, but haven't been successful in using it... yet!</li>
					  <li><a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/monk" target="_blank">Monk GitHub</a> - If you want to learn about using Monk, here's the official GitHub that outlines exactly how to write queries and so forth using it. Very useful stuff!</li>
					  <li><a href="https://github.com/mongolab" target="_blank">MongoLab GitHub</a> - Using <a href="https://mongolab.com/welcome/" target="_blank">MongoLab</a> was so easy. These resources on their GitHub (in addition to <a href="http://docs.mongolab.com/" target="_blank">the site documentation</a>) really helped a lot. Especially check out <a href="https://github.com/mongolab/mongodb-driver-examples" target="_blank">this repo</a> to get great examples of hooking a MongoLab DB either directly with Node or with Mongoose (or with many other languages outside of Node). I'm still using this resource to eventually move my app to using Mongoose instead of Monk.</li>
